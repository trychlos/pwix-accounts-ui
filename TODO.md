|      | 2023- 1-29 | implies to define a new dropdown item and a new panel |
|   29 | 2023- 1-26 | feat: manage several email addresses per user |
|      | 2023- 1-27 | even if the package itself should be capable, this is actually an application decision to manage that |
|   63 | 2023- 9- 9 | in izDate, many errors with textOne, textTwo textThree, textFour, legend and mandatoryBorder when trying to create a new account |
|   65 | 2023- 9-12 | feat: have a onUserCreated parm with nothing, dialog box or user function (but is it relevant client side) |
|   67 | 2023- 9-12 | feat: honor coloredBorders parm |
|   70 | 2023-10- 2 | validateNewUser() function should be only set on a acUserLogin option |
|      |            | as a new account is nonetheless created from acUserLogin, it is then possible to activate/unactivate it from the component |
|   71 | 2023-12-16 | with the birth of izIAM, AccountsUI MUST be capable being OAuth/OpenID client |
